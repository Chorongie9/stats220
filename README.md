## A little more about me 

This is my *repo* for __STATS 220__. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in computer science and statistics
- I am taking STATS 220 because learning about statistics interacts directly with computers and programming interests me, and I need to do this course as apart of my degree.
- I am interested in learning about how I can use technology to infer and learn more about data, and how modern technology has influenced statistics over the years.
