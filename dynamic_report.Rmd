## Observations from the Gym


In this report, I will go over observations that I notice at the gym, and the potential reasons for these observations. 

For this report, over a week I went to my home gym several different times at different time intervals in order to observe some patterns. The things I observed were what the most trained body part was at any given time I walked in, what type of headphones were predominantly used and what was the number of benches that were unused. 

Below are two bar charts - one is a chart to see what the most trained body part I was able to observe when walking in, and the second is a bar chart to show how often a certain number of benches was available when I walked into the gym. 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(magick)
latest_data <- read_csv('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ04B5fi8eIMpR6BER8-1_tTkbkE_GAuZbHfcaB5Uq19bqRKGwXopzb8aM_4kvITp4Uh5dQMw8rMGIp/pub?output=csv') %>%
  rename(time_arrived = 2, benches_available = 3, most_popular_headphones = 4, most_trained_bodypart = 5)
  
latest_data %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=most_trained_bodypart))

latest_data %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=benches_available))

#Finding the variables to use 
mean_benches_available <- mean(latest_data$benches_available)

#Attaining the variables I want to discuss
freq_table <- table(latest_data$most_trained_bodypart)
most_common_workout <- names(freq_table[which.max(freq_table)])
least_common_workout <- names(freq_table[which.min(freq_table)])
```
When going to the gym, we notice that on average there are `r mean_benches_available` benches available for use.

The most popular body part to train seems to be `r most_common_workout`, whereas the least popular is `r least_common_workout`.
